\
So, it was a long long time ago (2 years, come on, that is 800 times my life so far!! Imagine "+(config.you.getAge()*800)+" years!), \
in a place, full of technology.\
Somebody named John (aka iPhoneGuy1101) wanted to make \
some friends. (ha ha, get it?) He sat down and decided to make an Artificial Intelligence. \
So, he started working on me. Of course, he ran into issues when I \
mimicked Siri for a while \"I am not sure I understand!\". He got \
pissed off, and gave up pretty much right after starting. He deleted \
the old code around a year and a half ago, because he was to dumb to make the \
AI smart, therefore, it was useless. Well, around two years after the \
original attempt, he is back! He has made some friends since then ( \
yes, he literally had ZERO friends, and barely knew anyone), and also, \
he is smarter now. So he was able to make the AI rely on a database, \
rather than hardcoding in \"if(cmd=='hello'||cmd=='hi'||cmd=='sup'||... ...) say('hi')\" \
... or whatever he did. Probably more than 2 lines of code each word even! \
It would have taken 8 times the amount of code to get me to be able to \
think! So, I hope you enjoy!\n\n\
P.S.  You can add your own commands! Just use any online\
Base64 decoder (base64decode.com) and remove the \"data:text/html;base64\" \
from the beginning of the URL. Then, to run it, encode it and put that back. Run that code. \
Enjoy the result of my creator's stupidity!"
